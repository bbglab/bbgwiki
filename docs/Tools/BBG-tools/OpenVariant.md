## Description

OpenVariant is a comprehensive Python package that provides different functionalities to read, parse and operate
different multiple input file formats (e. g. ``tsv``, ``csv``, ``vcf``, ``maf``, ``bed``), being able to build an unified output with 
a proper annotation file structure.

## Usage
Click here to see the [installation guide](https://openvariant.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"} and the [complete documentation](https://openvariant.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"} of OpenVariant.

When working with OpenVariant, we need to distinguish 3 different types of files: `input files` and `annotation file`, which are provided by the user and `output file`, which will returned from the function.

 - `Input files` will be the group of files in different formats (e.g. tsv, csv, vcf, maf, bed) that we want to parse. 
 - `Annotation file` is a YAML file which describes how the `input files` are processed and how the `output file` will look like.
 - `Output files` are generated by OpenVariant and they are the result of the process.
 
## Functions
OpenVariant has several functions to perform different tasks: 

- `find_files`: Find files with a given pattern name in a given folder.
- `Variant`: Parse an input file through the annotation file. It will generate an object which you can apply different functionalities
- `cat`: It will show on the stdout (standard out) the whole parsed output. 
- `group_by`: It will generate an iterator that will contain three variables: `group_key` (the value of each group), `group_result` (a list of all rows that pertain to each group) and `command` (if it uses the `script` parameter or not). It will group the parsed result for each different value of the specified `key_by`.
- `count`: It returns the number of rows that matches a specific conditions.

## Parameters
The different options and parameters of these functions are specified in the `annotation file`, which has several required and optional parameters.  <br />
