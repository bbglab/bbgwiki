# Repositories of SVG icons

Here you can find a list of resources to download free SVGs:
 
- [**Iconpacks**](https://www.iconpacks.net): a repository of SVG and PNG icons from a wide range of topics, not only biomedicine related. These icons are free and can be used for both commercial and personal projects. You can also modify the icons as you wish (they even offer a customisation tool). No attribution is required, but they say that credit will be appreciated.

- [**Healthicons**](https://healthicons.org): a repository of SVG and PNG icons biomed-related. These icons are free and can be used for both commercial and personal projects. You are also free to modify the icons as you wish. No attributions is required. A cool feature is that you can send requests of icons that are not there.

- [**NIH Bioart**](https://bioart.niaid.nih.gov): a repository of SVG and PNG icons biomed-related. This is an initiative from the NIH. Most icons are of public domain so citation is appreciated but not required; however, there are other icons subject to other licenses, so I recommend looking to the citation guides.
