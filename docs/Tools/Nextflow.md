# Nextflow

!!! note annotate ""
    Nextflow enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers.
    It allows the adaptation of data-driven, computational pipelines written in the most common scripting languages.

## Usage

To run the default installed version of Nextflow, simply load the `nextflow` module:

```bash
$ module load nextflow
$ nextflow help

Usage: nextflow [options] COMMAND [arg...]
```

For usage documentation, run `nextflow help`.

### Submitting processes as serial jobs

!!! info annotate "Recommended for serial jobs only"
    This section is recommended for serial jobs only. For parallel jobs, please see the Parallel jobs section below.

Nextflow supports the ability to submit pipeline scripts as separate cluster jobs using the SGE executor.

To enable the SGE executor, simply set to `process.executor` property to sge in a configuration file named
`nextflow.config` in the job working directory. The amount of resources requested by each job submission is
defined in the [cluster options](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#clusteroptions) section, where all
Univa scheduler resources are supported.

For example, to run all pipeline jobs with 2 serial cores and 2GB of memory for 1 hour,
create the following configuration file:

```text
process.executor='sge'
process.clusterOptions='-pe smp 2 -l h_vmem=1G,h_rt=1:0:0'
```

!!! note annotate "Setting the memory limit for serial jobs"
    Add the `-DXmx` option to limit the amount of memory Nextflow can use in serial jobs. For more information
    regarding the Java VM memory allocation, see here.

### Parallel jobs

Parallel jobs will use the in-built Apache Ignite clustering platform; Execution will be performed on the nodes
requested in the submit request over MPI rather than submitting new jobs for each pipeline.

!!! warning annotate "Do not use the SGE executor in parallel jobs"
    Using the SGE executor for parallel jobs causes the master job to hang until it is killed by the scheduler
    for exceeding walltime. This is due to Apache Ignite not being able to communicate to other pipeline
    scripts submitted as separate jobs.

To ensure parallel jobs use Apache Ignite, add the following to the configuration file (or omit
the `process.executor` setting):

```text
process.executor='ignite'
```

### Example jobs

#### Serial job

Here is an example job taken from the Nextflow website to submit each process in the `input.nf` file as a
new cluster job with 1 core and 1GB of memory. Ensure the cumulative runtime across all processes does not
exceed the runtime requested in the master job:

```nextflow
#!/bin/bash
#$ -cwd
#$ -j y
#$ -pe smp 1
#$ -l h_rt=1:0:0
#$ -l h_vmem=1G

module load nextflow

nextflow -DXmx=1G \
         -C nextflow.config \
         run input.nf
```

#### Parallel job

Here is an example job taken from the Nextflow website to run each process in the `input.nf` file using 48
cores across 2 sdv nodes with Apache Ignite:

```nextflow
#!/bin/bash
#$ -cwd
#$ -j y
#$ -pe parallel 48
#$ -l infiniband=sdv-i
#$ -l h_rt=240:0:0

module load nextflow openmpi

mpirun --pernode \
       nextflow run input.nf \
       -with-mpi
```
