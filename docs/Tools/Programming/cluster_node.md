# VSCode in interactive node

## Description

These are the instructions to use Visual Studio Code to run and debug scripts/notebooks within an **interactive node** from the cluster.

## Requirements

-   **Conda** or **Mamba** installed
-   Have an account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

## Create a conda environment

The conda environment must include the packages `code-server`, `pyngrok` and `screen`

```bash
conda create -n vsc_node -c conda-forge code-server screen pyngrok -y
conda activate vsc_node
```

## Run code server in a screen (inside `login01`)

```bash
screen -S vscode
```

Right after creating the screen, create an interactive session and remember on which node you are allocated.

```bash
interactive
conda activate vsc_node
code-server
```

Exit the screen with `Ctrl + A + D`

## Run a Ngrok tunnel in a screen (inside `login01`)

!!! note

    If this is your first time doing this step, you'll first need to setup your authentification token for ngrok.

    1. Log in to your [ngrok home page](https://ngrok.com).
    2. On the left-hand side bar: `Getting Started > Your Authtoken`
    3. On the `Command Line` section, **copy only the key**, which is the big string with random letters and numbers.
    4. Go back to the terminanl in the cluster (with the `vsc_pyngrok` environment activated) and add your authentification token with the following command:

        `ngrok authtoken <the_token_you_copied_in_the_previous_step>`

    This setup only has to be done once.

```bash
screen -S pyngrok
```

```bash
interactive -w <bbgnXXX> # Node of previous step
conda activate vsc_node
pyngrok http 8080
```

Copy the URL to your browser and exit the session `Ctrl + A + D`

## Check your VSCode password

```bash
cat ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

## Browse your VSCode remotely

When entering the URL in your browser, click `Visit site` and introduce the password you obtained in the previous step in order to be able to use VSCode.
