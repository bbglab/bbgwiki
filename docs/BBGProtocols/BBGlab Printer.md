# BBGlab Printer Instructions

Instructions to print quick and fast from the BBGlab printer. 
Please note the actual printer model should appear in your PC as: **Colour-LaserJet-Pro-MFP-4302** (avoid the one with *_D86AAA_*!)

**Important**: Even if you set the BBGlab printer as the default in your computer's printer settings, the printer in the closest lab is often automatically recognized. This may result in accidentally printing to the printer in another lab. Please double-check before printing! 

**Disclaimer:** While we hope these instructions help improve the printing process, we cannot guarantee they will resolve all issues. Still, we believe it's better than nothing!

## Printing files from your computer

## Printing files directly from a USB device

1.  Insert USB to printer
2.  Now in the screen select: "Print".  Note that by default it prints **1 sided page in Black&White**. This might be different if a previous user has recently changed the configuration of the paper side or the colour.  

If you need to change the default configuration follow this:
-   To change Paper Side:
    1. First you need to change the paper size in the printer screen:   
	    Options >> More Options >> Paper Selection >> A4  
    2. Then you will be able to change to 2-sided:
	    Options >> More Options > Sides > 2-sided
-   To change the Colour:
	In the printer screen go to:  
    Options > More Options > Color > choose color
Then in the main menu go to Print.
