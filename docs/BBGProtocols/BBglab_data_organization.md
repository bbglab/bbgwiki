# BBGlab best practices on data organization

Here we present some best practices on how to organize data in projects in the **Cluster** and **Google Drive** to make your life easier and when day comes to be able to set up the **[BBGlab Exit protocol](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1veXAAucPqNQ2KIVFLyEJqPVjEeDcqsR-)**.

## Organizing the data

### Project Compilation

You MUST add the relevant information about your project to the ProjectCompilation excel for all the BBGlab members. It is the responsibility of all the people involved to keep it updated.    

Essential information both for finished and for on going projects:
 - Data
 - Scripts
 - Environments
 - Notebooks
 - Software (useful)
	- Local in your computer
		- Tools not installable in the cluster
		- Custom scripts
	 - Environments in the cluster
	- Tools installed in your user in the cluster (some /bin folder somewhere) linked to source code
- Figures
- Abstracts, Slides, Posters, Manuscripts

### Google Drive

You should have one directory per project shared (if necessary) with the people ivolved in the project. This directory MUST contain the following:

-   **Slides**
    
	It is good to include links to where plots were generated as much as possible. This directory would contain:

	-   FormalPresentations (not linked to conferences)
    
	-   WorkingMeetings / Project follow-up presentations
    
	-   NuriaSlides (link to Nextcloud or copy from there)
    
-   **Conferences**
   
	-   Abstracts
    
	-   Posters
    
	-   Slides
    
-   **Manuscripts**
    
	-   Mature versions of the figures including
    
		-   Images
    
		-   Link to code (i.e. GitHub repo)
    
	-   Text
		If different versions, make sure that the date is updated. Do not remove older versions, either make sure that the history is available or duplicate the file and store it in the OLD_versions folder.
	    

-   **Relevant papers**
    
	-   PDFs of those papers relevant for the project
    
	-   If there are any notes or summary from the paper, include it as well. (BUT NAME IT PROPERLY)
    
-   **Communications**
    -   Meeting notes (if relevant, usually it is)
    
	-   Content of relevant emails or slack conversations.
	- Relevant contacts


## Naming files / folders / …

Everywhere where you store files (Cluster, Drive, Cloud, Computer)

-   Use dates in YYYYMMDD format or YYMMDD.  
    Always year first…
    
-   Use informative words
    
-   No spaces replace them by "_"
