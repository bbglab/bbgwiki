# New BBGlab project protocol

These guidelines will help you to create a new project in the lab.

## Create project folders in the cluster

Check the cluster structure organization [here](https://bbglab.github.io/bbgwiki/Cluster_basics/Structure/#description). You can create the corresponding project folders within main directories:
-  Create project folder in `/data/bbg/projects/`
-  Create dataset folder in `/data/bbg/datasets/` or `/data/bbg/datasafe/` or s3.
 
## Properly organize your project folder

Remember to follow the [BBGlab best practices](https://bbglab.github.io/bbgwiki/BBGProtocols/BBglab_data_organization/) when organizing your project directory. In addition, you should fill and keep updated this [Project Compilation spreadsheed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jJleTek9eP4S6CCe5fO8_M4-vLuKhumgKjlQ58jP_rc/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

## Properly organize your google drive

You can also follow the [BBGlab best practices](https://bbglab.github.io/bbgwiki/BBGProtocols/BBglab_data_organization/) for that.

## Track changes in Git
You should have a Github account to track all your code in terms of version control and collaboration. You can create a github account if you don't have one yet. Check the [Git guidelines](https://bbglab.github.io/bbgwiki/Tools/Programming/git/).
