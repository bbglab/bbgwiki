# VPN

When working from home or outside the PCB, connecting to the VPN is neeeded in order to have access to resources such as the cluster.

Since December 2023, the setup for setting up the VPN has changed. Now, it is required to have a Two Factor Authentication using an Authenticator app.



## First Things First - Setting Up

After you changed your initial password to your preferred password, as explained in the letter, you are ready to set up your two-factor authentication needed for the VPN.

## Possible Errors

### VPN stuck on Login successful

With Ubuntu 22, if you keep getting stuck on "Login Successful", here is a fix:

In your terminal do:
```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dwmw2/openconnect
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install openconnect
```
This should fix the default way to connect to the VPN.
