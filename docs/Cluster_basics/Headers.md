# Headers

## Description

When you are in the cluster, in order to visualize the column names from a file with a table, you can use the command:

```bash
headers name_file.tsv
```

This will return you the name of the columns with the number of the column, for example:

```bash
1 tumor_type
2 gene
3 chr
4 pos
5 ref
6 alt
```
