# Structure

## Description
The workspace is organized in several folders, each of them with different purposes and different security backups. 



- **Projects** : Files from analysis or results obtained in the projects. It has backups and snapshots so it is **highly** safe.
- **Datasets** : Data files that have been downloaded from public or private repositories and re-downloading the is possible or straightforward. It only has backups, so it is **medium** safe.
- **No backup** : Intermediate files that have been generated during pipelines execution or big amounts of data that is re-downloadable. It is **lowly** safe.
- **Datasafe** : Datasets that have been generated by us or from collaborators, and it is not in public repositories. It has Snapshots and it is **highly** safe.
