# TCGA

## Description
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a landmark cancer genomics program, molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. This joint effort between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute began in 2006, bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines and multiple institutions.

TCGA has generated over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. The data, which has already led to improvements in our ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer, will remain publicly available for anyone in the research community to use.

Click [here](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/studied-cancers){:target="_blank"} to visualize the list of tumor types available in TCGA. For each cancer type, TCGA published an overview of the characterizations performed and an initial analysis of the data.  

## Data access
