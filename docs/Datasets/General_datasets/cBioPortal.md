# cBioPortal

## Description
The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is an open-access, open-source resource for interactive exploration of multidimensional cancer genomics data sets including molecular profiles and clinical attributes from large-scale cancer genomics projects.

The portal supports and stores non-synonymous mutations, DNA copy-number data (putative, discrete values per gene, e.g. "deeply deleted" or "amplified", as well as log2 or linear copy number data), mRNA and microRNA expression data, protein-level and phosphoprotein level data (RPPA or mass spectrometry based), DNA methylation data, and de-identified clinical data. However, for many studies only somatic mutation data and limited clinical data are available. For TCGA studies, the other data types are also available. Germline mutations are supported by cBioPortal, but are, with a few exceptions, not available in the public instance.
