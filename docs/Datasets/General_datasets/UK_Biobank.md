# UK Biobank

## Description
UK Biobank (UKB) is a large-scale biomedical database and research resource, containing in-depth genetic and health information from half a million UK participants. 
It is a very large and detailed prospective study with over 500,000 participants aged 40–69 years when recruited in 2006–2010.

The study has collected and continues to collect extensive phenotypic and genotypic detail about its participants, including data from questionnaires, physical measures, sample assays, accelerometry, multimodal imaging, genome-wide genotyping and longitudinal follow-up for a wide range of health-related outcomes.
It is accessible to approved researchers undertaking vital research into the most common and life-threatening diseases. <br/>

### Genomic data

UKB includes **Whole Exome Sequencing** data obtained from blood samples from nearly the whole cohort (about 470,000 individuals). Moreover, UKB also has **Whole Genome Sequencing** data obtained from blood samples from about 200,000 individuals and, by the end of 2023, it is expected to be extended to the whole cohort (500,000 individuals).

## Data access
Access to UKB data is restricted to authorized users that have to submit a research proposal to UKB. As BBGLab we can use the data on the study of the genetic basis of clonal hematopoiesis.
