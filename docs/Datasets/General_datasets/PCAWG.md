# PCAWG

## Description

The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study is an international collaboration to identify common patterns of
mutation in more than 2,600 cancer whole genomes from the International Cancer Genome Consortium.

Building upon previous work which examined cancer coding regions (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis project), this project explored the nature and consequences of somatic and
germline variations in both coding and non-coding regions, with specific emphasis on cis-regulatory sites, non-coding
RNAs, and large-scale structural alterations.

## Data access

```

You can find clinical data from samples from PCAWG in the file:

```bash
/data/bbg/datasets/intogen_datasets/genomes/pcawg_20160110/original_data/pcawg_donor_clinical_August2016_v9.csv
```

You can find clinical data from samples from Hartwig in the file:
