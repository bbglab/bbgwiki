# St. Jude LIFE

## Description
The objective of the St. Jude LIFE study is to establish a lifetime cohort of childhood cancer survivors to facilitate longitudinal clinical evaluation of health outcomes in aging adults surviving pediatric cancer.

The main aims of the project are:

- determine prevalence and latency of late effects;
- identify multifactorial predictors of adverse outcomes;
- develop risk profiles for adverse health outcomes across the age spectrum; 
- use data to guide health screening and risk-reducing interventions.
