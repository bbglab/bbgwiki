# TARGET

## Description

The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) program applies a comprehensive
genomic approach to determine molecular changes that drive childhood cancers. The goal of the program is to use data
to guide the development of effective, less toxic therapies.
