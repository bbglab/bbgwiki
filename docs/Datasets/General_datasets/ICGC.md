## Description

The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) is a global initiative to build a comprehensive catalog of mutational
abnormalities in the major tumor types. ICGC’s Data Portal is a user-friendly platform for efficient visualization,
analysis and interpretation of large, diverse cancer datasets.

The portal currently contains data from 86 worldwide cancer projects, collectively representing about 77 million somatic
mutations and molecular data from over 20,000 contributors.

ICGC Data portal also inculde cases from PCWAG and TCGA cohorts.

!!! warning "decomissioning"
    The ICGC Data Portal officially closed in June, 2024

While the interactive web portal has been decommissioned, the most recent release and PCAWG data remain available for
authorized users. For information on accessing ICGC 25K data, see the documentation for
[ICGC 25K Data Access](https://docs.icgc-argo.org/docs/data-access/icgc-25k-data).

If you have any questions please contact the [ICGC ARGO Helpdesk](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/contact)

### **New features**

- Data Release 28 was the last data release of the ICGC-25K Data Portal.
The ICGC Data Portal is no longer accepting data submissions.
- We are excited to announce the launch of the [ICGC ARGO Data Platform](https://platform.icgc-argo.org/), a major
milestone following the ICGC 25K Data Portal. ARGO represents an international effort to advance cancer genomics
through high-quality clinical and molecular data for international researchers.

## Data access

You can find the last data-version (2021) from ICGC in the folder:

```bash
/workspace/datasets/intogen_datasets/genomes/datasets/icgc/20211021/
```

## Download data files

ICGC data files (i.e.  bam files) are stored in different repositories depending on the ICGC project they belong.
Such repositories have their own architecture, data access controls, data portals and download clients.

- Cancer Genome Collaboratory
- GDC - Chicago
- PDC - Chicago
- EGA - Hinxton
- Azure - Toronto
- AWS - Virginia

 To download controlled data, a user must apply for access at the corresponding data access control body.

- US based projects are authorized by dbGaP.
- non-US projects are authorized by the ICGC Data Access Compliance Office (DACO).
