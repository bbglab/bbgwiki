## Description
The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) is a global initiative to build a comprehensive catalog of mutational abnormalities in the major tumor types. ICGC’s Data Portal is a user-friendly platform for efficient visualization, analysis and interpretation of large, diverse cancer datasets. 

The portal currently contains data from 84 worldwide cancer projects, collectively representing about 77 million somatic mutations and molecular data from over 20,000 contributors.

The ICGC Data Portal provides many tools for visualizing, querying, and downloading cancer data, which is released on a quarterly schedule.
