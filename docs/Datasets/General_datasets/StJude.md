# St. Jude

## Description
In 2010, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine launched a $65 million, three-year project (St. Jude—Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project) to define the genomic landscape of pediatric cancer, including some of the least understood and most challenging cancers, as an effort to discover the origins of pediatric cancer and seek new treatments. It included whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing of an additional 1,200 patients, which included more than 20 different cancers.
