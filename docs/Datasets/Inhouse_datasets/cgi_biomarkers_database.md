# CGI Biomarkers database

## Description

This database is used by Cancer Genome Interpreter (CGI) as a source to assess the relevance of
the alterations as biomarkers of drug response.

The biomarkers are classified by cancer type, drug response (sensitivity/resistance/toxicity) and the
level of clinical evidence supporting this association.

The database was created by several clinical and scientific experts in the field of precision oncology and it
is currently curated and maintained by the CGI expertise team, through reviewing the guidelines
(FDA-Approvals and NCCN Guidelines) on drug approvals.

The CGI Biomarkers database was last updated in October 2022.
