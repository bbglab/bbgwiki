# Reference Mutational Signatures

## COSMIC: Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer

- URL: [cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/)
- Extracted from tumors
- SBS, ID, DBS, CN and SV mutational processes
- Maintained by the Sanger Institute

### *Highlights*
- COSMIC displays for each signature a battery of analyses showing about tissue prevalence, strand asymmetry, enrichment of histone modifications, nucleosome occupancy, CTCF occupancy, etc.


## SIGNAL

- URL: [signal.mutationalsignatures.com](https://signal.mutationalsignatures.com/)
- Extracted from both tumors and experimental mutagenesis assays
- SBS, DBS and SV mutational processes
- Maintained by the University of Cambridge

### *Highlights*

- SIGNAL curates organ-specific signatures, consisting on typical profiles that can be realised as weighted combinations of mutational signatures at different organs.
  For example, [here](https://signal.mutationalsignatures.com/explore/referenceCancerSignature/60/organSpecificSignatures) is an example of which organ-specific profiles **Signature 1**
  contributes to depending on the tissue.
