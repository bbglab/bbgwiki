# How to Archive Data - BBGLab

Any folder in the cluster that we think should be archived we have to communicate it to Miguel.

## Description

We have [this google form](https://forms.gle/YNqdYYoaGvVcSyfE6)
to annotate any folder/dataset we want to archive.  
This way Miguel has a follow up table with all the listed data pending to archive.
