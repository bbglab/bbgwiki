# How to Archive Data - BBGLab

Any folder in the cluster that we think should be archived we have to communicate it to Miguel.

## Description

We have [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScelVDzYC7Apen-ibav_ltF6UrgzjNjYJoC7fInC4gPAwNAxw/viewform?usp=dialog) to annotate any folder/dataset we want to archive.  
This way Miguel has a follow up table with all the listed data pending to archive.
